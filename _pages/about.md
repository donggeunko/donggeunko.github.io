I am currently a graduate student in MAIN Lab @ Sungkyunkwan University, advised by [Prof. Jaekwang Kim](https://dramatic-samba-372.notion.site/Jaekwang-KIM-b5955ec7d50f488b8ff7bd29f9148641) and was a SKT AI Fellowship member with SKT Supernova team in 2022. I received my B.S degree in Molecular Biotechnology @ Ghent University Global Campus and wrote my bachelor thesis with the supervision of Utku Ozbulak and Professor Wesley De Neve. My major research interest lies but is not limited to computer vision, especially generative model, self-supervised learning and LLMs. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
